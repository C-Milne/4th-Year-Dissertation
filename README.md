# TODO
1. Give the parameter selection functions access to the domain and problem at the grounding stage (after post problem grounding).
2. Create a heuristic that estimates cost to goal - by comparing which of the goal conditions are already satisfied by the current model. Also ensure recursion does not impact this too bad
3. Create an improved requirement parameter selector that looks ahead to the requirements of subtasks and their subtasks etc. Aiming to get better results for JSHOP
