# Running the planner
There are two methods of running the planner, from the command line and by using the Runner class.

## Running from Command line
From the main project directory the planner can be initiated using the command:

```commandline
python ./Runner.py <Domain File Path> <Problem File Path>
```

Additional help can be found via the following command:
```commandline
python ./Runner --help
```

## Running Via Runner Class
The Runner class can be imported to a program and used to control the planner. The following example shows how the operations of the class can be used:

```python
from runner import Runner

controller = Runner(domain_path, problem_path)
controller.parse_problem()
controller.parse_problem()
controller.set_solver(Solver)
controller.set_search_queue(SearchQueue)
controller.set_parameter_selector(ParameterSelector)
controller.set_heuristic(Heuristic)
result = controller.solve()
```

# Example Problems
Example problems can be found in the Tests/Examples directory.

# Component Selection
Interchangeable components can be set from the command line or via the Runner class as previously seen.

Four types of component can be interchanged; Heuristics, Search Queues, Parameter Selectors, and Solvers.
When setting each of these components from the command line two pieces of information are need to be set - class names and file paths.

The following tables show the class name and file path pairs used to set components.

# Output
From the command line the plan found from a problem will be displayed on screen.
Using the Runner class a plan can be printed using the following method:

```python
Runner.output_result(Result)
```

The plan found for a problem can also be written to a Pickle file. From the command line the file path for output can be set using the following argument:
```commandline
python ./Runner <Domain File> <Problem File> -w <Output File Path>
```

Using the Runner class the same output can be achieved using the following method:
```python
Runner.output_result_file(Result, file_path)
```

An example of a plan being displayed is shown below:
![Plan Output](./images/Depots_Problem_Output.png)

## Output Plan Reader 
Plans saved to Pickle files can be displayed on screen by using the plan reader tool. The plan reader can be found in the Tests/Evaluation directory.
```commandline
python ./output_plan_reader.py <Output File>
```

# Running Unittests
All the unittests can be run from the Tests/UnitTests directory using the following command:

```commandline
python ./All_Tests.py
```
![All Unit Tests](./images/All_Tests.png)

# System Evaluation
System evaluation is composed in a similar manner to the unit tests. All evaluation files are contained in the Tests/Evaluation/Heuristic_Evaluation directory.
From here all evaluation tests can be executed using the following command:

```commandline
python ./AllEvaluationTests.py
```

The Tests/Evaluation/Heuristic_Evaluation/Archive directory is where all the results of the evaluation tests are stored.
Within this directory results are sorted by problem domain.
The <em>Heuristic_Evaluation_Data_Processing.ipynb</em> notebook visualises the results collected using graphs.
