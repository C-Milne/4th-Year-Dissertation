# TODO
1. Add compatability for constraints to tasks and actions
2. Test with debugger for some example problems
3. Get / Create SHOP parser
4. Combine SHOP parser with established codebase
5. Implement breadth first with pruning - If multiple subtasks are given in the beginning of search. Add them one at a time to the search_modifiers so duplicate states can be pruned
6. Implement way for parameter selection to be done the same way as a heuristic


# Things to Test
1. Type Hierarchy - Create a simple blocksworld - or satellite01 IPC test
